# shellcheck

The [bash-language-server](https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server) support shellcheck.
But you need to [install it manually](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck#installing)

```bash
brew install shellcheck
```

# shfmt

lsp support format

> https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/pull/1136

```bash
go install mvdan.cc/sh/v3/cmd/shfmt@latest
```

# tldr vs man

`bash-language-server` use `man` to show document ðŸ‘€

The markdown rendering is completely bad

So, let's just use the documentation provided by tldr (it's really a markdown display!)

github: https://github.com/d1ylab/bash-language-server

npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/neo-bash-ls
